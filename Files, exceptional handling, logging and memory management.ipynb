    "      - Code is executed line by line by an interpreter.\n",

    "      - Often used for scripting, web development, and rapid prototyping.\n",
    "    - Compiled Language:\n",
    "        - Code is transformed into machine code by a compiler before execution.\n",
    "        - Faster since the code is already translated into machine language before execution.\n",
    "        - Errors are detected during the compilation process before the program is run.\n",

    "***2.  What is exception handling in Python?***\n",
    "- Exception handling in Python allows you to manage and respond to errors during program execution using try, except, else, and finally blocks. It ensures the program continues running smoothly even when unexpected issues occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "***3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?***\n",

    "***4. What is logging in Python?***\n",
    "- Logging in Python is a way to record and track events that occur during the execution of a program.\n",
    "The logging module in Python provides a flexible framework for generating log messages at different severity levels. These levels include:\n",
    "    - DEBUG: Detailed information, typically useful for diagnosing problems.\n",
    "    - INFO: General information about the application's execution.\n",
    "    - WARNING: Indications of potential issues that aren't errors.\n",
